## 🎯 Purpose

* Practice **data structures and algorithms** in Java.
* Strengthen problem-solving skills for **technical interviews**.
* Keep a **reference for future coding challenges**.

## 🔍 Patterns Practiced

Some common algorithmic patterns covered in this repo:

* **Array / String**: Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
* **Hash Map / Set**: Counting, frequency maps, deduplication
* **Stack / Queue / Heap**: Valid parentheses, sliding window max, priority queues
* **Binary Search**: Searching sorted arrays, rotated arrays
* **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization and iterative DP (medium-hard problems)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in your preferred Java IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Install the LeetCode extension.
4. Navigate to a problem folder and run the `.java` files.
5. Use as a reference for **learning patterns or preparing for interviews**.
