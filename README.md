# üíª LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode solutions repository**! This repo contains my personal solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems implemented mostly in **Java** organized by **difficulty** and **programming language** used.

## Time Complexity Comparison

| Input Size (n) | O(log n) | O(n) | O(n log n) | O(n¬≤) | O(n¬≥) |
|---------------:|:--------:|:----:|:----------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 10 | ~3 | 10 | ~33 | 100 | 1,000 |
| 100 | ~7 | 100 | ~664 | 10,000 | 1,000,000 |
| 1,000 | ~10 | 1,000 | ~9,966 | 1M | 1B |
| 1,000,000 | ~20 | 1M | ~19.9M | 1T | 1Q |
| 1,000,000,000 | ~30 | 1B | ~29.9B | 1Q | 1S |

**Legend:** M = Million, B = Billion, T = Trillion, Q = Quintillion, S = Sextillion
